# reap

_reap_ allows to once define a task an than execute it over and over again from the command line.

## Motivation

This tool allows to define _plans_. Each _plan_ consists out of one or more _tasks_. Each _task_ is a small step to achieve a bigger task.
I use it to automate the deployment process of a specific program:

* Stop the service
* Unzip the package containing the release
* Delete the old release
* Copy the new release to the correct folder
* Replace some strings in the configuration
* Execute a command to update a database
* Check the database logs for errors
* Start the service

## Usage

Instead of writing a (Power-) shell script the steps are defined in a _json_ file.

Place your _plans.json_ in the same folder as the _reap_ executable.

It is possible to define global variables that will be used to replace otherwise repeatitive values. (See parameter `Variables` in _plans.json_ example.)

A simple _plans.json_ could look like the following one setting the password in a config file.

```json
"Plans": [
        {
            "Name": "Replace the string 'PLACEHOLDER_PASSWORD' in the file 'config.ini' with 'MyPa55w0rd' in ",
            "Variables":{
              "CONFIG_PATH": "/opt/mytool/config.ini"
            },
            "Tasks": [
                {
                    "Type": "ReplaceInFileTask",
                    "Preferences": {
                        "FilePath": "${CONFIG_PATH}",
                        "Replace": "PLACEHOLDER_PASSWORD",
                        "With": "MyPa55w0rd"
                    }
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

Run the program and enter one of the following commands:

* `execute`: Execute a plan (i.e. `execute -p 1` to execute the first plan)
  * `-p [PLAN_ID]` (_PLAN_ID_ can be found using the `list` command)
* `list`: Show a list of all available plans and their task as defined in the _plans.json_ file
* `help`: Show a list of avilable commands
* `clear`: Clear all output from the console
* `exit`: Quit the program

### Available tasks

The general structure of a task looks as follows. It consists out of a _type_, and (optional) _desciption_ and _preferences_. The _preferences_ are individuell to every task.

```json
{
  "Type": "ConfirmationTask",
  "Description": "Ensure the database update was executed.",
  "Preferences": {
  }
},
```

#### ConfirmationTask

Ask the user to confirm something. This can be used to give instructions to the user to execute a task that can't be executed by this tool.

* `Question`: The question/task the user needs to answer/perform.

```json
{
  "Type": "ConfirmationTask",
  "Description": "Ensure the database update was executed.",
  "Preferences": {
    "Question": "Has the database been updated to the latest version?"
  }
},
```

#### DeleteTask

#### TemplateTask

## Build

### Windows

To build the _exe_ in a a way that it requests administrator privileges (embed a _manifest_) use the following commands:

Get [goversioninfo](https://github.com/josephspurrier/goversioninfo)

```shell
go get github.com/josephspurrier/goversioninfo/cmd/goversioninfo
```

Clone the repository. (**Attention:** Must be cloned into the `$GOPATH/src` folder.)

```shell
git clone https://github.com/ChristianAEDev/reap.git
```

Navigate into the project folder

```shell
cd reap
```

Get all dependencies

```shell
dep ensure
```

Create the file needed to create the _exe_

```shell
go generate
```

Build the programm

```shell
go build
```
